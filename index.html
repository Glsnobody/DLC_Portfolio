                    <p>The idea of taking a photograph that captured the essence of my younger sister led me to make "The eyeliner."
                        As I wandered through the possible options, I realized that nothing could better define the direct, unfiltered, intimidating, and determined personality that she possesses other than the concept behind the eyeliner. Her expressive face with the knife as a symbol of her intimidating personality along with the eyeliner reminds me of one of the phrases she often says, "Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man."</p>

                    <p>There are love stories that are just around the corner or that happen for no reason, perhaps because they were meant to be. Approximately 3 years ago, through a text message that led us to an extensive debate on problematics  and ideologies of the modern society, I managed to coincide with what would be the beginning of a somewhat unusual love story. This gallery was a personal project, to capture the connection and the story behind our love.</p>

However, as they go about their busy day, they don’t always see the beauty of the city. You can find many forms of art walking around New York, whether it’s paintings, clothing, or music there is always something unique to enjoy. The way most New Yorkers seem to miss one of the most beautiful aspects of the city is something I wanted to capture.</p>

However, This narrow definition of what a man should be is socially constructed and does not accurately describe the various ways in which men can be masculine. I wanted to showcase a man in a more untraditional setting to prove that masculinity is more than what society defines for us.</p>
