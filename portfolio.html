          <h2>The Eyeliner</h2>
          <p>
            The idea of taking a photograph that captured the essence of my
            younger sister led me to make "The eyeliner." As I wandered through
            the possible options, I realized that nothing could better define
            the direct, unfiltered, intimidating, and determined personality
            that she possesses other than the concept behind the eyeliner. Her
            expressive face with the knife as a symbol of her intimidating
            personality along with the eyeliner reminds me of one of the phrases
            she often says, "Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man."

          <h2>Coincidence - Not a regular love story</h2>
          <p>
            There are love stories that are just around the corner or that
            happen for no reason, perhaps because they were meant to be.
            Approximately 3 years ago, through a text message that led us to an
            extensive debate on problematics and ideologies of the modern
            society, I managed to coincide with what would be the beginning of a
            somewhat unusual love story. This gallery was a personal project, to
            capture the connection and the story behind our love.

            New York is a city constantly in motion, and the people who live
            there move quickly and confidently. However, as they go about their
            busy day, they don’t always see the beauty of the city. You can find
            many forms of art walking around New York, whether it’s paintings,
            clothing, or music there is always something unique to enjoy. The
            way most New Yorkers seem to miss one of the most beautiful aspects
            of the city is something I wanted to capture.

            Home is a safe place that allows us to put aside the hardships of
            life and just relax. Being away from this safe place is hard but
            it’s also one of the most important steps we take in life as we grow
            up. A home isn’t perfect, they have flaws and imperfections, but
            nothing can match those feelings of safety, security, and love when
            you are there.

          <h2>Masculinity: Just a social construct</h2>
          <p>
            Masculinity is a rigid term used to describe the social expectations
            of what it means to be a man. Traditionally, men are usually meant
            to be seen as strong, stoic, and brave. However, This narrow
            definition of what a man should be is socially constructed and does
            not accurately describe the various ways in which men can be
            masculine. I wanted to showcase a man in a more untraditional
            setting to prove that masculinity is more than what society defines
            for us.

            For Dominicans "Ei Patio" is like a way to say: the place we are
            from, in this case, Dominican Republic. For this project I went
            around local places to show people a different side of DR that they
            normally wouldn't see. I took pictures on digital and also film to
            create another perspective of my country. As I was driving around, I
            met with locals that happily gave me the opportunity of
            photographing them. I hope people enjoy the journey of knowing my
            country through my lens.

            These photos were inspired by a dream I had about this chair
            standing in the water. There was something about the stark contrast
            of these two things that didn’t go together that heavily inspired
            me. I drove 4 hours to Monte Cristi to recreate what I had seen in
            my dream.

            The woman in this photograph is a very well known and loved person
            from San Francisco de Macorís in The Dominican Republic. She sells
            coffee and cookies on the same corner every morning. I found it very
            interesting how this very humble and unassuming lady is a very
            important part of the daily lives of the people who live there.

            Beauty standards heavily impact our society. People of all races and
            genders have been subject to all sorts of impossible beauty
            standards that destroy our own self-image. The mirror represents the
            desires and obsessions we have over our own image and the lingering
            feeling of wanting to be enough to fit into this world.

            experimented with the lighting and shadows.

            Women have been fighting for equal opportunity for many years,
            especially when it comes to career advancement. This glass ceiling
            prevents women from rising to powerful positions and taking on
            higher responsibilities due to discrimination. “Boss” is my way of
            showing that powerful woman in positions of power should be
            normalized.

          <p>
            Love is one of the strongest emotions we have. It motivates us and
            helps us grow into better people. Behind every piece of love in this
            world there is a story about connection, vulnerability, support,
            safety, and happiness. When people are in love, they can look at
            each other and see these emotions through their eyes. They have a
            connection so strong they are able to peer through each other’s
            souls and see their true emotions.
